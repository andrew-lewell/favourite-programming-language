The objective of this code challenge was to build a Rails app that computes a user's favourite programming language based on data from the GitHub API. My solution uses the Octokit gem to fetch this data. 

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run 'bundle install' in the terminal.
3. Run 'rails db:create' in the terminal.
4. Run 'rails db:migrate' in the terminal. 
5. Run 'rails s' to start the server, and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/find".
